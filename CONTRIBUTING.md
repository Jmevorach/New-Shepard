I'd like to invite anyone who wants to make Shepard better to contribute.
I'm really eager to work with anyone who'd like to improve Shepard and I love learning new things.
I'm going to try my best to faciltate a friendly and open exchange of ideas vis-a-vis Shepard.
To anyone out there wanting to contribute new code or to improve existing code I look forward to working with you. Let's build things together.
